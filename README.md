# Speech-to-Text
Speech recognition is the ability of computer software to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to human-readable text. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can convert speech to text in Python using the SpeechRecognition library.

As a result, we do not need to build any machine learning model from scratch, this library provides us with convenient wrappers for various well-known public speech recognition APIs (such as Google Cloud Speech API, IBM Speech To Text, etc.).
